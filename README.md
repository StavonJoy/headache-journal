# Headache Journal

This is a full-stack MERN application that I made to track my headaches. Now, it's a practice playground for me to learn new technologies and concepts.

## Todo

- [ ] More inputs on entries
- [ ] Change "headache" to "pain"
- [ ] Remove unused code
- [ ] New UI style with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Validation for entry inputs 
- [ ] Calendar view of entries

## Todone

I switched to an internal database instead of using MongoDB. I also added docker and made some small UI changes to fix broken CSS. I wrote this a while ago and had to fix some pieces but it's a work in progress!
